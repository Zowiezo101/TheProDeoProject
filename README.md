# TheProDeoProject
This repository is a shelved and unfinished project of mine, waiting for a new owner who likes to continue the project! It started out as a dream to create a game with factual correct historical information about the Bible, but the factual correct history part has gotten so big that I needed a database to store all the information in. Since I wanted to share this information, I decided to start working on a website that displayed all this info in a "human readable way" with timelines, familytrees, worldmaps and tables. 

Aside from wanting to make a game, I also wanted this to be a gift to God. Something to help people realise that the Bible is more than a dusty old book abused to justify many bad christian behavior, hate, rasicm and other trash. It is a collection of historical stories, rewritten many times with customs and behaviors of a different time. A time that it very different from the time we're currently living in and thus not always suitable to be taken literally.

I believe that God is not the same for everyone, since everyone is different and has different needs. He's not a one-size-fits-all solution, but a person with His own desires and thoughts. It's important to learn who you are and who God is to you. These projects started out as a love letter to Him, given to the people. I've set the foundation for the website and database projects and will continue with working on the original dream of mine, the game. Maybe I'll ever pick up this project again in the future, but perhaps there is someone else out there who feels like this could be their gift to God as well.

## Why is it shelved?
I lost sight of my original plan of making a game and having fun myself. I am a perfectionist and it costed me about ten years to realise I was reaching way too high for a project ran by a single person. So I needed to make the tough decision of pruning away some projects, until the game itself was left. I've tried to package the database/website project as neatly as possible, with as much documentation on the code, environment and goals as I can.

## Two parts
The ProDeo Project is divided into two larger parts, the database and the website. Both have their own development environment that can be created by using Docker. Docker makes it a lot easier to get all the necessary tools needed to run both projects from your own computer with minimal effort.

### Database
The database contains the actual information itself. All the Bible books, people, locations and some information that doesn't fit exactly in those categories. The database is a MySQL database, but using the development environment it can be imported to and exported from a set of text files in a human readable format.

### Website
The website is the tool used to visualize the database in a way that is much easier to understand than a bunch of tables and rows. I've written some code to generate a timeline and a familytree with the data in the datbase, so it can be easily filled up and edited with more recent data.

## Help out
Do you want to help out or adopt the project? Please contact me! This project is really special to me and I want to be sure any contributors or possible new owners will be a good fit for this project.

## Check the Wiki
The Wiki contains more information on how the directory is structured, how the code works and other detailed information.

## The bow on the gift wrapping
This README is meant as the little bow on the gift wrapping of the present. I've been working on this project for over ten years with love for God, to eventually give something to the people who want to get to know Him better. I'm sad to shelf this project, but this is for my own health. It's time for me to work on something different with renewed joy and a fire in my heart. Thanks for the family and friends that have supported me all these years to get this far, and thanks to God who gave me the passion and a distraction from many difficult and hard years with this project <3.
