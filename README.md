In order to start working on the Database, you also need to use the repository DatabaseHelper. 
This second repository is used to create the development environment needed to update the Database.

Read the [Wiki](https://github.com/ProDeoProductions/ProDeoDatabase/wiki) to learn more about this database, what it's used for and how to help out.
