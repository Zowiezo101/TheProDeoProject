## Welcome to the Website Helper Repository!
The contents of this repository are to be used to set up a development environment for the [Website](https://github.com/ProDeoProductions/ProDeoWebsite). This environment is set up using Docker, creating so called "containers" to create a working virtual webserver and database server. The website and database repositories are both included as subrepositories in the website helper repository. This will make it easier to work on the website code while also testing it using the website helper as development environment.

## Docker
As mentioned before, this project uses Docker. More on Docker and how to set up can be found in the wiki, but  if you have already installed Docker and need a quick reminder on how to start the webserver and database: `docker compose up --build` in a terminal is all that you need.

## Wiki
The [Wiki](https://github.com/ProDeoProductions/WebsiteHelper/wiki) contains more information on how to set up the development environment and how to work on the website code.
