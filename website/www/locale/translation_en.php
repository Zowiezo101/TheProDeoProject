With a job, a household, a loving husband and a chronic disease I don't have a whole lot of other options then to divide my time properly.

	"about_prodeo.title"=>"About Prodeo: <br>",
	"about_prodeo.overview"=>"Prodeo started (and still is) as a passion project that comes forth from the love for God, the Bible and men. The Bible is often seen as an old dusty book with many register of who birthed who, many rules and laws and difficult prophecies. Aside from that, the Bible contains beautiful and powerful stories and handy information to learn more about the cultures and habits of those times. To make all this information a bit more understandable and clear, I decided to work on a database with corresponding website. With this I hope to help people understand the Bible better.<br><br>This website can be used as a handy tool for the Bible. There is a database available with people, locations, Biblebooks, events and some other stuff from the Bible. There is also a timeline with events, a worldmap with locations and a family tree with people from the database. As much information as possible is collected (like parents, place of residence, founders of cities, ages etc.). Please be aware that the database currently is based on the dutch Bible translation abbriviated with \"NBV\"<br><br>The name Prodeo means 'For God' in Latin and is often used in the Dutch languague as 'free'. For me it is important that the content of the website applies to both meanings of the word, free and for God.<br><br>If you want to help by donating, you can do that via this link:<br><a href='https://ko-fi.com/prodeoprojects'>https://ko-fi.com/prodeoprojects</a>",
