    /*
        The variable $http_accept_language can contain string like:
        fr-CH, fr;q=0.9, en;q=0.8, de;q=0.7, *;q=0.5
        
        This weird combinations of characters is a regular expression:
        It is divided into groups, using the ( and )
        
        Group 1: ([\w-]+)
        Group 2: (?:[^,\d]+([\d.]+))?
        Group 3: ([\d.]+)
        
        Group 1:
        \w means, look for a to z, A to Z and _
        [\w-] means, look for either (range described above) or a dash
        The plus means to look for groups of character that match what is described in the previous line
        
        So according to the example, the first group would contain:
        fr-CH     fr        en         de        q
        
        Group 3:
        \d means, look for 0 to 9. 
        [\d.]+ means, look for a group of characters that contain a dot or a digit.
        According to the example:
        0.9        0.8        0.7        0.5
        
        Group 2:
        ^ means not to look for the specified characters.
        [^,\d]+ means to ignore groups of characters containing a digit or a comma.
        According to the example:
        fr-CH    .    fr;q=    .    en;q=    .    de;q=    .    *;q=    .
        
        But since group 3 is IN group 2, the results of group 3 are also taken into account.
        This means that the match is only valid if it is followed by any of the results of group 3.
        According to the example: ( and ) means group 3.
        fr;q=(0.9)    en;q=(0.8)    de;q=(0.7)     *;q=(0.5)    

        For the full matches, all these groups need to be combined.
        The ? behind group 2, means that group 2 doesn't necasserily needs a match for a full match
        So a full match is when group 1 has a match, and possibly followed by any of te results of group 2.
        According to the example: [ and ] means group 2, ( and ) means group 3.
        fr-CH    fr[;q=(0.9)]    en[;q=(0.8)]    de[;q=(0.7)]     [*;]q[=(0.5)]
        
        Since group 2 contains the character combination ?:, the results of group two itself are not saved.
        Only the results of group 1 and group 3.
        According to the example:
        Full matches:    fr-CH    fr[;q=(0.9)]    en[;q=(0.8)]    de[;q=(0.7)]    [*;]q[=(0.5)]
        Group 1:        fr-CH    fr                en                de                q
        Group 3:                0.9                0.8                0.7                0.5
        
        These results are stored in the variable $matches. Each result in it's own index ($match).
        The full matches in sub index [0], group 1 in sub index [1] and group 3 in sub index [2]
