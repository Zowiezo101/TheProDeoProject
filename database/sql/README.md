## Welcome to the Database Repository!
This repository is used for the SQL database file. Having a whole repository for a single database file seems like overkill, but it's the easiest way to share this file between repositories without having to include the development environment as well.

## DatabaseHelper
If you are planning on helping out with the database, you need to check out the [DatabaseHelper](https://github.com/ProDeoProductions/DatabaseHelper) repository instead. It also contains this repository as a sub-repository. Remember that you need to be added to the database team for write permissions to both this repository and the DatabaseHelper repository.

## Wiki
The [Wiki](https://github.com/ProDeoProductions/ProDeoDatabase/wiki) contains detailed information on the contents of the database and how it can be used to show this information to anyone who is interested.
