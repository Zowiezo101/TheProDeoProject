# Welcome to ProDeo Productions!

Welcome to the member page of the ProDeo Productions organization. This page is mainly for new members and people who just got started in ProDeo Productions. Once the team starts growing, there might be more information in here.

## Getting started
First, I'd like to thank you for helping out with ProDeo! I greatly appriciate your help and hope that together we can create something meaningful. If you've never worked with GitHub before, I suggest reading some of their documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started) to know what GitHub is and how it works. 

There are a few ground rules for working on a project, that are meant to keep things fair and fun for everyone. These [rules](#ground-rules) are explained further down this page. Please try to abide by those rules. If you fail to do so, it can result in losing your access to any of the projects or even be banned from the teams.

If you think you are ready to start working on a project, I suggest to read the project specific documentation. Each project has its own README file with information and some have a link to a Wiki page for that project. You can find the list of projects [here](https://github.com/orgs/ProDeoProductions/repositories).

So far, each project consists of three parts (repositories):
- **Working code**: This is the actual project itself. It's the version that will be used by others, for example, on the website. 
- **Development environment**: This part contains everything needed to develop and test the working code.
- **Admin environment**: If you have admin responsibilities, you also get access to this part. It contains what is needed to fulfill those admin responsibilities.
	
Each project also has it's own planning (called a project in GitHub). These plannings can be found [here](https://github.com/orgs/ProDeoProductions/projects).

In order to work on a project, you need to be added to the corresponding team. If you notice you aren't added to the correct team, just ask and I'll try to resolve it.
	
## Ground rules
These ground rules are meant to keep the peace and make sure everyone feels safe. If you notice you aren't feeling safe with someone, or someone is not abiding by these rules, it's important to let me know. I'll try to resolve it or to find a solution to the problem.

### Respect each other
Everyone is different and everyone has different views on things. If you notice someone is uncomfortable with a subject or conversation, agree to disagree and stop the discussion. Accept that there are people with opposite opinions on things. This is does not invalidate your opinion or view on things, it just means they have different experiences with said subject.

Even if people accept you for who you are, there will always be some aspects of your life that others might not understand or are not interested in. You are valid and beautiful the way you are, but not everyone gets along and that's alright.

### Respect yourself
Working on these projects is voluntary. School, work and personal life are important. Set boundaries and feel free to say no, but keep in mind that we depend on each other for certain tasks. This means that you sometimes need to let go of a task and let someone else work on it, when you might not have the time to do so yourself.

Don't let anyone force you into doing something you are not comfortable with. If you feel someone is crossing a boundary you've clearly set, let me know and we'll try to resolve it together.

### Respect the projects
These projects are my babies and I have been working on them for over 10 years now. I accept suggestions and don't mind discussions about them, but understand that I have my own view/plan with them. Don't try to take over and go your own way with these projects, without discussing things with me first. If we can't get to an agreement, it's not gonna happen.

### Respect the users
These projects are meant to help whoever needs what the projects have to offer. Being user-friendly is more important to me than being trendy and making money.

Unfortunately, services aren't always free and so far I've been able to pay for them with my own money. Once costs are getting higher, I'm fine with finding ways to earn some coins here and there. But it should never interfere with staying user-friendly, be forced on users or be any form of "pay2win". However, users are free to donate whenever they feel like.

## Becoming an admin
Being an admin comes with an extra set of responsibilities and I need to be sure that I can fully trust you with those responsibilities and the project. It means that you get access to sensitive information, maintain your projects team, documentation and the planning, and update the live version of the website/database.

If I don't feel like I can trust you enough with those responsibilities yet or have any other reason to decline your request to become an admin, I ask you to be mature about it and accept it. This doesn't mean that you'll never be an admin, it just means I need more time to see that you are capable enough for those responsibilities.

If you become an admin, do not abuse those extra privilages. The other team members are just as important and valuable as admins. If I notice that you are not behaving or are looking down at others for being an admin, I have every right to revoke your admin access.

## Leaving the team
Leaving the team should be possible whenever you feel like. All I ask you to do is to save any changes you've made. Taking a break is fine too, but keep in mind that after a few weeks of inactivity I might remove your access to some stuff out of safety. You can always regain it whenever you decide to help it out again.

If you leave because something made you feel unsafe or uncomfortable, let me know and we'll try to find a solution to the problem.
