## Becoming a team member
If you aren't a team member yet, make sure to send an email to ProDeoProductions2u@gmail.com explaining why you'd like to be a part of the team and how you can help. Your help is much appreciated and will help me to finish this project faster and more on to other projects I'd like to make.

Even if you have no programming knowledge or aren't a christian, your help can be very valuable.
