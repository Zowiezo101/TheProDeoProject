Seeing as the project is temporarily shelved due to the overwhelming amount of work this is for a single person, the project isn't finished yet. There is still quite some work to do and bugs to be fixed, safety issues to look at and a website to update for a better user experience.

## Future plans
- As of now, localisation is done using both JSON and PHP files for each available language. It's much easier to maintain these using JSON files
- Implement some sort of login service so people can use their own API keys when the global API keys have been used up for the month
- Automatically disable the API when the global API keys have been used up for the month
- Make the website more mobile-friendly and friendly for all browsers in general

## To be done
Bug fixing and beautification.. There's a lot of this to be done.

Right before shelving, I was working on removing the search page and including a search filter on the other pages instead. This might or might not be implemented, but in case it's not then the changes will be saved to a feature branch called `feature/reimplement_search_page_#37`.
