Dear reader, welcome to the ProDeo Website Wiki!

This Wiki is for anyone who is a part of the ProDeo Website Team, or who wants to be part of the team. It contains a more detailed explanation on a few things. Use the sidebar on the right to go to a specific subject.

## The Website Helper
I know it can seem confusing at first, but keep in mind that this repository is only for the actual source code of the website and not the development environment. Same goes for this Wiki, if you want to learn more about the development environment for the website, please go to [the Wiki for the Website Helper](https://github.com/ProDeoProductions/WebsiteHelper/wiki).

## Becoming a team member
If you aren't a team member yet, make sure to send an email to ProDeoProductions2u@gmail.com explaining why you'd like to be a part of the team and how you can help. Your help is much appreciated and will help me to finish this project faster and more on to other projects I'd like to make.

Even if you have no programming knowledge or aren't a christian, your help can be very valuable.
