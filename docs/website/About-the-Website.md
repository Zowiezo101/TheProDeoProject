# Some background information
Somewhere in 2014 I decided I wanted to create a science fiction game based on the Bible, with the same goal as the website has now. It started out as an idea for an Android app that uses several sensors on your phone to create this AR experience. I wanted to overlay world maps from biblical times over our current world map and have players "roam around in biblical times" while solving puzzles and playing games. The story would play out in both our current time AND biblical times and learn the players about their customs, historical events, etc..

Fun fact about me, I'm autistic and I love facts and hate (accidentally) spreading misinformation. Oh, and I'm also a perfectionist. So having a story be factually and historically correct would mean that I need a lot of information for that game, information that isn't always specifically mentioned in the Bible and needs to be researched and linked back to specific verses and chapters of the Bible.

I've been collecting information for 2 years before I decided it was way too much to put in a single Android app.. So I decided to split up that Android app into a cross platform game, containing of 12 chapters. TWELVE WHOLE GAMES, each with their own story lines, factually correct information and following the exact events of the Bible. I got overwhelmed, decided to change up the story line to be less factually correct and move the factually correct information to a website to help others out.

Having many projects, I still got overwhelmed and had to go back to my roots. So now I'm just working on this website and the database.

# Why the website?
As explained on the public page GitHub of [ProDeoProductions](https://github.com/ProDeoProductions?view_as=public), I am a visual learner and decided to create a website to help other people as well. But why did I have to create my own website and not use, for example, Wordpress or Wix? 

While the database isn't done yet and I still need to add a lot of information, new information and discoveries keep popping up. What if Jesus is an alien waiting to come back with his spaceship to take us to mars? (I'm joking of course) But, building an entire family tree or timeline, only to find out that something is missing or doesn't belong there, means that I have to redo the entire family tree or timeline. 

So, I created my own API to build the family trees and timelines based on the information I currently have in the database. It isn't perfect, but I couldn't use existing APIs as some people from that time liked to marry their cousins. And most existing APIs do not support that (not the free ones anyway). Web hosts like Wordpress and Wix do not support these kind of things and make it very difficult for me to connect to a database. That, and I just really liked the idea of creating my very own website at the time.

There are some other reasons as well, but these were the main reasons for creating my own website.
