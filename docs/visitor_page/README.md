# Welcome to ProDeo Productions!

## About me:
I am an enthusiastic christian who has many dreams and ideas to help people understand the Bible better. Unfortunately, I'm just a single person with limited abilities due to chronic illnesses, so for now I'm only working on a large Bible database on https://www.prodeodatabase.com. 

Christians don't have the best reputation of being accepting of others. Which is funny, because Jesus usually hang out with the underdogs and anyone who was rejected by society. God is the source of love and life and I believe He's in everything that contains love. People might know Him under different names, shapes or forms, but if something contains love, you can be certain He's there. He's the source of it after all. Out of love I try to respect all beliefs and life visions, but I won't always respect and accept all behaviors and actions. 

My dream is for people to learn about God and who He truly is. Not what other christians have told you about Him, but who He is to you personally. Some people need a loving and chill friend, others need a stern father and some people could really use a lesson in being humble. Everyone is different, has different needs and stories and they all are valid.

## About ProDeo Productions
In my language (Dutch), ProDeo means doing something free of charge. It also means "For God" in Latin, or more specifically "For the sake of God". I'd like to think I'm working on this database (and perhaps even more in the future) with both of those meanings. For God (to the people) and free of charge for anyone to use. It's a way for me to show my love to both God and the people.

If I ever manage to finish it or have people who'd like to help me with the database, I'd also love to work on a science fiction game based on biblical stories! The database is an insane amount of work, so for now that idea just remains exactly that, an idea. A few years ago, I had a big list of projects that I wanted to make under the name ProDeo Productions (or ProDeo Projects), but it got so incredibly overwhelming that I had to make the difficult decision of putting those ideas aside and just focus on my main goal: The Bible Database.

## Why the database?
I'm a visual learner. Reading line after line of who begat who is just a blurry string of words, but put it in a family tree and things get a lot clearer for me. Same goes for timelines, world maps, etc. I just want to help other visual learners with this website that contains a lot of information in a single place. The entire Bible is a big book, and I started somewhere in 2014. I've reworked the website twice and am currently still working hard on improving the website and adding info to the database. I'm not sure if I'll ever finish this project in my lifetime!

Another reason I'm working on this database has to do with my love for science and factual information. Let's be honest here, the Bible has been rewritten and translated countless times, the stories have gone over centuries and most likely have been retold in many different ways (like the telephone game). People had different sayings and cultures in those old times and it can cause the Bible to seem incorrect or unlogical. Using different sources, I'd like to sketch the most logical and factual timelines I can make, by explaining their cultures and making sense of certain stories and events. It won't be easy and I won't always be correct, but I still like to try. Even if it's just for myself.

## Help needed
Like I mentioned before, the database is a huge project and I have been working on it for many years. Anyone who is interested in helping out with it, feel welcome to contribute. You do not need to be a christian for this or even believe in any god. As long as you have an interest in biblical stories and respect my vision on life.

While GitHub is mainly used for programming, you do not necessarily need programming knowledge to help me out. Finding sources for historical events, scientific stuff, geographical information and anything else related to biblical information will help me out a lot. 

*I do need to mention that this project is my baby and has been for over 10 years, so I take it very seriously. I genuinely want to help other people with it.*
